executeAction and executeAnimationAction(Entity)
 could be used by either Entity or EvenScheduler due to using both as parameters and they both manipulate an entity and
 and is in a way a scheduled event. Moved to Entity do to using a lot of instance variables from it, meaning less moving

distanceSquared and nearestEntity (WorldModel)
 distanceSquared acts like a generic math function and nearestEntity is the only one which uses
 it, findNearest was moved to WorldModel however making WorldModel the only class which calls the above
 thus moved to WorldModel to act as a helper

getNumFromRange (Entity)
 this is a generic math function but only used by Entity so moved to act as a helper

clamp (Functions)
 another math function only used by Worldview so moved to be a helper

parse load creates (Functions)
 somewhat generic and not belonging to any one class

setAlpha, getImages (Functions)
 used only by the functions right above so same reason as the above
